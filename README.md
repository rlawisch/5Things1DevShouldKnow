# Motivation
To increase the knowledge of juniors developers so they can find themselves in a better position and to list the most frequently commented topics between juniors developers & to set up a starting point to people which are looking to increase the knowledge on the development world.

# FAQ
* Do you want to know more about DRY / Object Oriented-Programming / Refactor, etc? 
  * Check the [structure]() to see it.

* Is it for me? 
  * If you are a person which is tired to feel that you do not know where to look for the things, yes.

* There is a typo, can I fix it?
  * It is awesome to get your contribution, if you want add a *new comment*, *fix*, *new content* or etc... simply open a [PR](https://github.com/LuisValgoi/5Things1DevShouldKnow/compare).

* What it accomplishes? 
  * It has knowledge for developers and interested on that that want to have a base knowledge on the fundamentals topics mostly commented in the dev-world.
